# **Task 1: Save Changes Temporarily with `git stash`**
1. Make changes to a file without committing:  
   ```bash
   echo "Temporary changes" >> temp-file.txt
   ```
2. View the status of changes:  
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - **Output**:  
     ```
     Changes not staged for commit:
       modified:   temp-file.txt
     ```
     3. Stash the changes:  
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```
   4. View the stashed changes:  
   ```bash
   git stash list
   ```
