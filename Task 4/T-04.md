# **Task 4: Rebase Commits to a New Base**
1. Rebase the current branch onto `main`:  
   ```bash
   git rebase main
   ```
 

2. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during rebase, and continue:  
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

 ##  ** explain -this branch all commits are add top of the main branch and same branch commits are conflicts so we resolve and continue is use for commit resolve file . **
