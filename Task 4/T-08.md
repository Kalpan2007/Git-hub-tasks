# **Task 8: Pick a Specific Commit**
1. View the commit history to find the commit hash you want to cherry-pick:  
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

2. Cherry-pick a specific commit by its hash:  
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   ```
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     git cherry-pick e23d8a7
     ```

3. Resolve conflicts if any, then commit the changes:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git cherry-pick --continue
   ```
