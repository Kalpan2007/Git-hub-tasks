# **Task 8: Handling Merge Conflicts**
1. Create two conflicting branches and resolve a conflict manually:  
   ```bash
   git merge <branch-name>
   ```
2. Use:  
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   git commit
   ```


##  ** explain - first a merge two branch after a resolve that branches because in same file different codes so resolve it and commit the resolve changes . **
