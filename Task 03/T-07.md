# **Task 7: Understanding Branching**
1. List all branches:  
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
   - **Explanation**: Displays the current branch and all other branches.

2. Create a new branch:  
   ```bash
   git branch feature-branch
   ```
   3. Switch to the new branch:  
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```
   - **Alternative Command**:  
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-branch
     ```


 ##  ** explain - first to know to how many branch are there and we are in which branch after that crate a new benach named feature-branch after switch on this branch and second command do both in ine command  . **
