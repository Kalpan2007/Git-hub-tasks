# **Task 10: Simulate a Merge Conflict**
1. Modify the same line in a file on two branches:  
   ```bash
   echo "Main branch content" > conflict.txt
   git add conflict.txt
   git commit -m "Added conflict.txt in main branch"
   ```

2. Switch to the other branch and make conflicting changes:  
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   echo "Feature branch content" > conflict.txt
   git add conflict.txt
   git commit -m "Modified conflict.txt in feature-branch"
   ```
   3. Merge `feature-branch` into `main`:  
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

4. Resolve the conflict by editing the file and choosing the correct version:  
   - Open `conflict.txt` and decide which changes to keep.
   - Stage the resolved file:  
     ```bash
     git add conflict.txt
     ```
   - Commit the merge:  
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Resolved conflict in conflict.txt"
     ```



 ##  ** explain - in first create a file and add this file to staging area and commit this file   . **



  ##  ** explain - switch into feature branch and create a same name file after add this file to staging area and commit it  . **


  ##  ** explain - switch to main branch and merge main with feature branch  . **


##  ** explain - is that same name file and in this file differnt content so it merge conflict so resolve this and after that commit  . **
