# **Task 7: Branching and Merging**
1. Create a new branch for a feature:  
   ```bash
   git branch feature-login
   git checkout feature-login
   ```
   Or use:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-login
   ```
 ** explain -this both are same work crate a branch and  change the branch to  new branch. **

2. Add a new file and commit changes:  
   ```bash
   echo "Login Page" > login.html
   git add login.html
   git commit -m "Added login page"
   ```
 ** explain -crate a login file add that to staging area and commit that file   . **

3. Merge the feature branch into `main`:  
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-login
   ```
  ##  ** explain - first change branch to main and after that merge that login file to main   . **
