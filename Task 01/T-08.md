# **Task 8: Handling Merge Conflicts**
1. Create two branches:  
   ```bash
   git branch branch-A
   git branch branch-B
   ```

2. Modify the same line in `README.md` in both branches.  
3. Merge `branch-A` into `main`:  
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge branch-A
   ```
4. Attempt to merge `branch-B` into `main` (this will cause a conflict):  
   ```bash
   git merge branch-B
   ```
5. Resolve the conflict manually in `README.md`, then:  
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between branch-A and branch-B"
   ```
  ##  ** explain - First make a two branch after a making change to main branch and merge the files and resolve it. . **
